## Our Story

BlockCluster.io began in 2017. Few years after invention of Blockchain, we realized that it was near impossible for the average enterprises or governments to create their own blockchain applications with the toolsets and platforms available. Traditional platform services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.

We created the BlockCluster BMS with the enterprises perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would require no coding skills. We keep it simple, so enterprises can focus on creating an amazing blockchains that reflects their consortiums. Best of all - it's cheap. You can use the public cloud version or install it on-premise with enterprise license.

After seeing an increased need for blockchains solutions, we developed one of the only fully-featured, cheap and hassle-free platform, allowing business owners to launch their own blockchains.

Today, we're proud to empower individuals and business owners around the world. Everyone deserves a chance to explore and use blockchain, and we're excited to see what you create.
